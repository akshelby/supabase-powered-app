# SP Granites - E-Commerce Platform

## Overview

SP Granites is a full-stack e-commerce web application for a granite, marble, and stone products business. It includes a customer-facing storefront with product browsing, cart/wishlist, order management, estimation requests, and live chat support, alongside a comprehensive admin dashboard for managing products, orders, users, content, and analytics. The app uses a React frontend with Supabase as the backend (authentication, database, storage).

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend

- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript, built with Vite and SWC for fast compilation
- **Routing**: React Router DOM with BrowserRouter for client-side navigation
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS variables for theming (CRED-inspired palette: deep forest green primary, rich red accents, clean black/white neutrals). Uses the shadcn/ui component library built on top of Radix UI primitives
- **Internationalization**: i18next + react-i18next for multilingual support (English, Hindi, Kannada). Translation files in `src/i18n/locales/`. Language preference persisted in localStorage
- **State Management**: React Context API for global state (CartContext, WishlistContext, AuthContext). React Query (@tanstack/react-query) for server state and data fetching
- **Animations**: Framer Motion for page transitions and UI animations
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod schema validation
- **Component Library**: shadcn/ui (configured via components.json). Components live in `src/components/ui/`. Path alias `@/` maps to `src/`

### Backend (Supabase)

- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with email/password login
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control via `user_roles` table (admin, moderator, user)
- **Client**: Supabase JS client at `src/integrations/supabase/client.ts`
- **Types**: Auto-generated Supabase types at `src/integrations/supabase/types.ts`
- **Note**: Some tables use `as any` casts for tables not yet in generated types (e.g., contact_numbers)
